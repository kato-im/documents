Welcome to Kato

###This is an introduction to using Kato.
Right now you should see two rooms; they are very special.
-  This room is your **KatoPad**. It's a private place for you to record all your thoughts.
-  The room on the left is **Support**. You can reach Kato central at any time using this room.

<a name="description"></a><h3 id="description">[^](#toc "Jump to TOC") 1. What is Kato?</h3>
 After several years of working in small distributed teams, we realized that chat is the lifeline of our work. We use chat to discuss issues, features, schedules. We use chat to monitor deployments, code commits, and problems with servers. Chat history becomes our documentation, our long-term memory store, the journal of our work.

 Eventually it became clear that we complained a lot about the chat services we were using. Our chat didn't stack up to the rest of our development tools. Our fancy dinner was perfect except for the bent aluminum forks.

 We wanted a chat tool that works so well we'd forget we're using it. We wanted to read without clicking around. We wanted to search history without walking away from a conversation. We wanted history that never goes away. We wanted to paste code and have it compile on the other end without errors. We wanted a chat service that is as reliable as a landline telephone. We wanted Kato.

####Search!
 Online communication often contains the collective memory of your organization. Unfortunately, most of this memory is lost or difficult to find due to poor search, indexing, and discovery tools.

 Kato is engineered with fast and powerful search technology from the bottom up. This allows teams to leverage all their previous communication immediately and spend their time working on what they do best.

####Multiple Conversations
 Other messaging software still silos conversations in separate windows. Companies handicap their employees with the task of managing screen real estate instead of communicating freely.

 The dashboard design of Kato unifies conversations in one window and centralizes message notifications. The productivity payoff is immediately recognizable. Seeing is believing!
 
####Quickly Catch Up
 Email is cumbersome, especially around internal collaboration. The daily grind of handling inbox overload accounts for more wasted time than any other process during the work week.
 
 Merging both real-time and asynchronous communication, Kato intelligently controls the information flow for you. Hours will be saved every day, immediately multiplying the amount your organization can accomplish. Kato is not a new inbox, it simply gets more workflow out of the inbox and into realtime communications to improve productivity.

####Integrate
 Businesses often choose a number of separate apps to automate and enhance common tasks but this results in data silos and wasted time finding the right stuff. It can even hurt productivity instead of enhancing it.

 In Kato, organizations can pull all these services together and receive real time updates when events in 3rd party systems occur. Kato’s easy-to-use [integrations](kato.quora.com/Kato-Integrations-List) support a number of business cases so every team member stays on the same page.

####Share Files
 Sharing files, images, or videos often happens in the context of a conversation. Yet, it is common to see files, images, or videos separated from the surrounding discussion. This causes the attention of the reader to be diverted to another application or website.

 Kato offers straightforward file and media sharing within the context of a conversation. It is possible to share files with a Dropbox integration, file selection dialog, drag-and-drop, or copy-and-paste.

 Search (with a capital S) is Kato's most important feature. Being able to discover all your communication data means you no longer have to fall back to email for vital communication. Paired with missed message highlighting, we think Kato is the most powerful internal communication tool available today.

 Go ahead and open search in this room, it's the magnifying glass in the upper right corner. Type in "Kato" and explore all the different instances of it in this document. Whenever you want to reread this document just search "Welcome To Kato" and you'll be right back here.
